# SortingVisualisation
A sorting visualisation program in Python, made with Pygame

## TODO
- Add controls to control the speed
- Add fun data to the sorter and display it, add info like the number of items, a running count of the iterations, just fun stats to see
- Add more algorithm types to the sorter
- Add Sounds
- Improve Renderer code, it works off essentially magic numbers and guesswork right now and needs to be robust and work with any item amount
- Add option to visualise the shuffling instead of having it happen instantly
- Massively improve the speed of the program so at max speed it isn't as slow as it is currently
- Add multithreading support
