# SortingVisualisation
A sorting visualisation program in Python, made with Pygame

## TODO
- Add controls to the sorter, a way to stop the sorting, a way to step one at a time, a way to slow it down, a way to control the speed, ect
- Add fun data to the sorter and display it, add info like the number of items, a running count of the iterations, just fun stats to see
- Add more algorithm types to the sorter
- Add UI:
menu for changing algorithm type which would include a short description of the algorithm and its compute times,
menu for changing colours,
menu for changing algorithm settings- such as the speed or the number of items
- Add Sounds
- Improve Renderer code, it works off essentially magic numbers and guesswork right now and needs to be robust and work with any item amount
- Add option to visualise the shuffling instead of having it happen instantly
- Massively improve the speed of the program so at max speed it isn't as slow as it is currently
- Add multithreading support
